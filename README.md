# Rules for Reporting Issues

* Error related Issues **MUST** include a log file. Your Issue will be closed immediately if there is no log file included.
* You must check all open Issues to see if your problem is being addressed already.
* **Do Not** hijack an open issue with unrelated problems. Open a new Issue.
* It is your job to monitor the Issue you have opened. If I need additional information and it is not supplied, I will close the Issue.
* If your Issue is Trakt related, you **MUST** have observed this behavior for at least 48 hours before posting an Issue here. Trakt has a fragile API that often doesn't perform for small periods of time.
